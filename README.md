This is a big project I have been working on for quite some time now! 

The idea started on the first day of my job, when I got home and originally made a website to store my logins, so I could access them online the next day. I then expanded the project with sections I felt I could also use at work, including a space to write notes, and also a place to store templates for repetitive emails

Throughout the site, clicking on a note will automatically copy it to the clipboard, which comes in very handy with my work. 

I have duplicated the latest version of my site to share the code, and so that it can be tested by anyone. 

Please note that some of the names in the code for sections might be different to the titles as I often switch sections for different uses, however they do work exactly as you'd expect. 

I hope you enjoy testing it and please let me know any feedback you have. 

Thank you, 
Rishi
